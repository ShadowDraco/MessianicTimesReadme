## What's the process?

</div>

- **Start with research**
  - I use plenty of time to familiarize myself with the situation, context, and needs.
  - Learn about the tools that can be used to solve to problem
  - Ask people who know more to confirm my choices
  - Narrow it down to only the best
- **Work very close with the client**
  - Throughout the process it is essential to make sure that all decisions about tools to use and direction to take are correct before starting development.
  - Devise a plan _that will work for the client and myself_ before writing a single line of code
- **Take the time to:**
  - Create wire frames and diagrams
  - Verify all of the features that are expected/required
  - Create a project board and _use it_
- **Once again before writing code:**
  - Bring all of your resources to the client with a good and accurate presentation of the everything that is about to begin
